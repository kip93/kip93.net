                    <p>Right after I finished the previous project, the company started moving some of their most skilled employees into a new team with the
                       purpose of developing an all new initiative: <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/composer/">MuleSoft Composer</a>. This is aimed
                       at expanding our tooling for simpler tasks, broadening the possibilities for the non-technical users.</p>
                    <p>In this new endeavour, I have gone from leading a single of its core backend components to becoming one of the key players on the whole
                       backend platform. From day one of the project I have helped with the analysis, design, and development of a microservices focused
                       platform; driving the product all the way to GA and beyond.</p>

                    <p>After the end of the Internship I was offered the opportunity to continue working at the company while I pursued my software engineering

                    <p>I took ownership of a project named
                       <a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev-guides/how-to-tutorials/munit-test-recorder/">MUnit Test recorder</a> centred around simplifying
                       our clients' development process, allowing to easily test and validate the correct functionality of their software, reducing time and
                       effort. In order to achieve this goal, it was required to coordinate interactions across several teams to bring a smooth and cohesive
                       experience to the end users.</p>
                    <p>By the end we saw 30% adoption increase and 25% usage compared to the old process within the first 3 months of the release of the new
                       tool, and overwhelmingly positive feedback from our clientele.</p>

                    <p>As time went by, I began to feel that I had been learning a lot more and in much more depth while working than I had ever done at the

                    <p>After diving into the Electronic courses I found that programming was what really motivates me, and so I opted to continue my studies as
                       a software engineer. But because of my career change decision, I felt I needed to acquire some work experience. Although the tuition at
                       ITBA was great, the timetables did not allow me to work, that is why I chose to continue at UADE.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>We present an implementation in graphical processing units of a numerical algorithm for the simulation of the nonlinear propagation of
                       pulses in optical fibres. The implementation uses NVidia's cuFFT library to perform the large number of FFTs calculations required and
                       parallelises all vector sums and products. We show up to 50x speedups as compared to a single-core implementation on a PC.</p>
